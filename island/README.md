## Features Change log

### Week 46

Currently no real feature available, some work being done but not visible by the bot, creating stop action. NO risk being taken.

### Week 47

Bot is able to fly over and scan a part of the map (actually about 50% of the map is discovered after the flying phase).
After this phase, we just land on the last creek we found, and stop right after this, if we find no creek, we just stop
before supposed landing.

### Week 48

No modification viable and sure since last week, so actually same guarantees as week 47, better take no risks and stay
alive.
So we still land on a creek we found, safely.

### Week 49
We land on the first creek we find, and then stop, we prefer guarantee safety than trying to harvest without certainty.
PS: We didn't find any creek.

### Week 50
We are pretty sure that we'll find a creek, then we land on it and try to parse the island and collect some interesting resources in objective
to fulfill a contract.

### Week 51
We land on a creek after visiting a part of the map that we record in our own IslandMap. Then we move and we exploit just to check
if we're able to for the incoming weeks.
We guarantee that we won't die.

### Week 52
...

### Week 53
Some minor improvements. Let's go 2K16.

### Week 1
Welcome to 2016, no real code improvements due to a calendar overload.

### Week 02
Code testing validated! We reached the 80% as fixed by the client, we can now code properly and propose new features soon.

### Week 03
Ski week: no improvements. Some new features in the ground phase but this is unstable so we don't use it for now.

### Week 04
And at this moment Patman knew.. they fucked up.

### Week 05
We realized our strategy was not very effective. But we know why, and how to change the points that's are not good. See you next week with a better strategy!

### Week 06
We fucked up once more, happy Valentine's day.

### Week 07
Tagged an old week to make sure we compile and come back alive.

### Week 08
We finally harvest some resources, patman is back alive!

### Week 09
We got a temporary strategy, ~50% chance to win a wood contract. (We achieve 3 contracts on week03 :p)

### Week 10
New features aren't finished, so we will use the week09 strategy.

### Week 11
Something stable and working, let's go!!!

### Week 12
Final version with contract analyzer, enjoy!
